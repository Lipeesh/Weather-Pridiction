This Projects works on CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) in this project we use image based and labeled(Green, Cloudy, Desert, Rainy) data that are stored in different
directories with their label as the directory name. To train model we have picked multiple images at random from all the directories after training the accuracy of the model is 92.25%.
To Test the data we pick a single image at random to test if model is giving right prediction or not.
To plot the the graphs and display image data Cv2 and Matplot is used.
